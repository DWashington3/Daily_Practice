  ### April 9th

**FOCUS: Begin to familiarize myself with HTML and JavaScript**

**TECHNOLOGIES: Plotly, HTML and JavaScript**

Tonight I decided to refocus on JS. I really have a million projects I want to explore but after taking almost a month off I need a refresher so that means getting back to the basics.
Today I played with plotly to create some plots:
- [x] Line Graph
- [x] Horizontal Bar Graph
- [x] Vertical Bar Graph
- [x] Scatter Plot
- [x] Pie Chart

I used Visual Studio as my environment and the Git Bash terminal to commit my work. 

**TROUBLESHOOTING** 
- I struggled to get the objects of the horizontal bar graph to show in my live browser. While inspecting I noted the element didn't show at all. I moved onto the next plot to determine if it was an issue with the JS file or HTML file. The same  occurred when I tried to generate my scatter plot. Thus it's an issue with my index.HTML. file. 

- RESOLVE: I made  a new <body> tag for each plot which was preventing them from rendering. I nested the plots all within one <body> tag. This successfully fixed my issue.

Tomorrow's Goal
  
- [ ] Recreate these plots with Python in Jupyter Notebook
- [ ] I will note the data sets used, as they were randomly generated [Random.org](https://www.random.org/integer-sets/?sets=3&num=50&min=1&max=100&seqnos=on&commas=on&sort=on&order=index&format=html&rnd=new).
- [ ] I need to format my [github page](https://dwashington3.github.io/Daily_Practice/) but for now I have it lauched for daily tracking. 


  
  
### April 10th
  
Today I added the captions, detailing what data was used to generate each plot. 
I also made a copy of my index.html file so that i can develop one into a dashboard and play with the plotly library in the other.

  - [x] Add data detals to each graph.
