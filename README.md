**FOCUS: Begin to familiarize myself with HTML and JavaScript**

**TECHNOLOGIES: Plotly, HTML and JavaScript**

Tonight I decided to refocus on JS. I really have a million projects I want to explore but after taking almost a month off I need a refresher so that means getting back to the basics.
Today I played with plotly to create some plots:
- Line Graph
- Horizontal Bar Graph
- Vertical Bar Graph
- Scatter Plot
- Pie Chart
I used Visual Studio as my environment and the  Git Bash terminal to commit my work. 

**TROUBLESHOOTING** 
- I struggled to get the objects of the horizontal bar graph to show in my live browser. While inspecting I noted the element didn't show at all. I moved onto the next plot to determine if it was an issue with the JS file or HTML file. The same  occurred when I tried to generate my scatter plot. Thus it's an issue with my index.HTML. file. 
- I need to form mat my github page but for now i have it lauched for daily tracking. 

- RESOLVE: I made  a new <body> tag for each plot which was preventing them from rendering. I nested the plots all within one <body> tag. This successfully fixed my issue.

**Tomorrow my goal is to recreate some of these plots with Python** and I will note the data sets used, as they were randomly generated from the link listed in the resources.
