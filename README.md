  ### April 2nd 
  
  Well, that wasn't daily practice. Haha! I've managed to do light VBA practice at work almost daily, however, I have a desire to learn other things! I learned I really enjoy DevOps. My team is fairly new but very valuable so i personally want to better my skills. 
  
  So I said all of that just to say my focus has changed and I will be practicing different things daily. 
  My new intrest consist of the following: 
 -  JIRA cloud
 -  Confluence
 - JQL
 - Python
 - SQL
  - Miro
  -  VBA
  - Excel
    
  I don't really have an elaborate plan to build anything, but i will be checking in daily to work on something.   
    
    With that being said i am feeling extremely overwhelmed with the skills I should remember but have forgotten so I think before i even get to the skills mentioned above i have to relearn  git bash commands, and branch basics. That’s going to be critical to my documenting my process daily so i will start there. Also, since I do daily work with confluence and JIRA i will work on how i can document that work legally with my work restrictions.

**Objective 1:** Relearn Version control, Git Basics, and look into bitbucket

[i am starting here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started)

And i am going to use datacamp since i really like how they explain the WHY/ Mechnaisms behind certain things, whihc is very helpful fro my science brain.

  ### April 9th

**FOCUS: Begin to familiarize myself with HTML and JavaScript**

**TECHNOLOGIES: Plotly, HTML and JavaScript**

Tonight I decided to refocus on JS. I really have a million projects I want to explore but after taking almost a month off I need a refresher so that means getting back to the basics.
Today I played with plotly to create some plots:
- [x] Line Graph
- [x] Horizontal Bar Graph
- [x] Vertical Bar Graph
- [x] Scatter Plot
- [x] Pie Chart

I used Visual Studio as my environment and the Git Bash terminal to commit my work. 

**TROUBLESHOOTING** 
- I struggled to get the objects of the horizontal bar graph to show in my live browser. While inspecting I noted the element didn't show at all. I moved onto the next plot to determine if it was an issue with the JS file or HTML file. The same  occurred when I tried to generate my scatter plot. Thus it's an issue with my index.HTML. file. 

- RESOLVE: I made  a new <body> tag for each plot which was preventing them from rendering. I nested the plots all within one <body> tag. This successfully fixed my issue.

Tomorrow's Goal
  
- [ ] Recreate these plots with Python in Jupyter Notebook
- [ ] I will note the data sets used, as they were randomly generated [Random.org](https://www.random.org/integer-sets/?sets=3&num=50&min=1&max=100&seqnos=on&commas=on&sort=on&order=index&format=html&rnd=new).
- [ ] I need to format my [github page](https://dwashington3.github.io/Daily_Practice/) but for now I have it lauched for daily tracking. 


  
### April 10th
  
Today I added the captions, detailing what data was used to generate each plot. 
I also made a copy of my index.html file so that i can develop one into a dashboard and play with the plotly library in the other.

  - [x] Add data detials to each graph.
  
 ### April 13th 

 I'm eager to start manipulating data with JavaScript so I think I will start on that today.
 - well, i forgot what the .map() did so i'm going to play with that and looping through data to get started. I am using my google chrome browser console. 

 ///<insert 4.13.22.map here>

 The "num" parameter that goes inside function can be named anything. That's simply an arbitrary name for the parameter. This provides me the ability to create transformations in my data that are clearly defined, and probsbly several other things now that i sit and reflect. I can divide, multiply, add to any array in a "loop-like" fashion.
  - im pretty sure we can do it with Objects as well. I'm going to try!
  - but first I am going to make sure i understand  how to create an object. I know that i will make Keys: values pairs, I just need to ensure correct syntax. 
    - In my first attempt to run my own object in the console i ran into a syntax error.
    - Second attempt:
    - Third attempt:

  Now I will try implementing the .map() Method:


  Since that was a sucess, I started playing with .filter()
